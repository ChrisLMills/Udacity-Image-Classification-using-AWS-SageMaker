# Udacity-Image-Classification-using-AWS-SageMaker

In this project, I demonstrated the finetuning of the ResNet50 pre-trained model for classification of images from the CIFAR10 image dataset. 
The project is made up of the following steps:

1. Data uploading and preprocessing
2. Model def
3. Dataloader def
4. Training def
5. Testing def
6. Hyperparamter Search
7. Debugger and Profiler setup
8. Model training
9. Endpoint deployment
10. Prediction

*Data uploading and preprocessing*
